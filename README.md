# NumPy Learning Journey  

Welcome to my NumPy learning journey! This repository is dedicated to my exploration and practice with the NumPy library. Here, you'll find various examples, exercises, and notes as I make progress in understanding this powerful Python library for numerical computing.  

## 📚 Overview  

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the foundational package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.  

## 🔍 Learning Objectives  

In this repository, I aim to:  
- Understand the core functionalities of NumPy.  
- Explore array creation, manipulation, and operations.  
- Learn about NumPy's mathematical functions and utilities.  
- Apply NumPy in real-world scenarios, such as data analysis and scientific computing.  


## 🚀 Getting Started  

To get started with NumPy, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install NumPy via pip:  

```bash  
pip install numpy
